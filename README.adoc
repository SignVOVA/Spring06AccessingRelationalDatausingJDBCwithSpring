This guide walks you through the process of accessing relational data with Spring.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application using Spring's `JdbcTemplate` to access data stored in a relational database.

== What you'll need

== Create a Customer object
The simple data access logic you will work with below manages first and last names of customers. To represent this data at the application level, create a `Customer` class.

`src/main/java/hello/Customer.java`

== Store and retrieve data

Spring provides a template class called `JdbcTemplate` that makes it easy to work with SQL relational databases and JDBC. Most JDBC code is mired in resource acquisition, connection management, exception handling, and general error checking that is wholly unrelated to what the code is meant to achieve. The `JdbcTemplate` takes care of all of that for you. All you have to do is focus on the task at hand.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
    
- `@Configuration` tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration` tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@ComponentScan` tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the `hello` package. In this case, there aren't any.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn't a single line of XML? No **web.xml** file either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn't have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

Spring Boot spots *H2*, an in-memory relational database engine, and automatically creates a connection. Because we are using *spring-jdbc*, Spring Boot automatically creates a `JdbcTemplate`. The `@Autowired JdbcTemplate` field automatically loads it and makes it available.

This `Application` class implements Spring Boot's `CommandLineRunner`, which means it will execute the `run()` method after the application context is loaded up. 

First, you install some DDL using `JdbcTemplate`'s `execute` method.

Second, you take a list of strings and using Java 8 streams, split them into firstname/lastname pairs in a Java array.

Then you install some records in your newly created table using `JdbcTemplate`'s `batchUpdate` method. The first argument to the method call is the query string, the last argument (the array of `Object` s) holds the variables to be substituted into the query where the "`?`" characters are.

NOTE: For single insert statements, `JdbcTemplate`'s `insert` method is good. But for multiple inserts, it's better to use `batchUpdate`.

NOTE: Use `?` for arguments to avoid http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection[SQL injection attacks] by instructing JDBC to bind variables.

Finally you use the `query` method to search your table for records matching the criteria. You again use the "`?`" arguments to create parameters for the query, passing in the actual values when you make the call. The last argument is a Java 8 lambda used to convert each result row into a new `Customer` object.

NOTE: Java 8 lambdas map nicely onto single method interfaces, like Spring's `RowMapper`. If you are using Java 7 or earlier, you can easily plug in an anonymous interface implementation and have the same method body as the lambda expresion's body contains, and it will work with no fuss from Spring.

You should see the following output:

== Summary
Congratulations! You've just used Spring to develop a simple JDBC client.
